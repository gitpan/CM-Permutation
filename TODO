about module
------------

the interface for the CM::Group class should be 

arrayref    -> elements
order       -> order of the group(number of elements)
conjugate   -> 


separate all tests in appropriate test files(atm some tests about Sym.pm are in CM-Permutation.t and so on)

add a class CM::Group::ConjugacyClass that will contain as attribute ->elements with the elements ->group with a reference
to the group which this class belongs to and ->type (in the case of ::Sym group) with the type of the class depending
on the cycle structure
(this would have been necessary to make the test doing this in CM-Group-Sym.t more natural)

Dist::Zilla

haven't found a way to include "use 5.010000;" inside the generated
Makefile.PL
